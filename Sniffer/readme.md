<h2 align="center">Rust Packet Sniffer</h2>

<p align="center">
Just a simple packet sniffer written using rust. Only a project for me to learn rust and how to use it.<br>
Shows Incoming/Outgoing Packets (You have to insert the right interface name at top of script tho.)<br>
Way of choosing will be implemented soonish<br>
Shows UDP/TCP and should show ICMP Packages (Only tested on UDP and TCP)<br>
Will show other Packets with same source ip and port and same destination ip and port when coming after each other as [n] after the packet<br>
